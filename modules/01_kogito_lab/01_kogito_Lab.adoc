WARNING: Please perform all lab activities - except those involving a browser - on the workstation virtual machine. +
While it is possible to perform the lab on your laptop - provided you have all the required tools installed - we ask you not to do so, in order to preserve network bandwith, especially when doing Maven builds or uploading/downloading Docker images.

== Use Case

During this workshop we will create and deploy a software system for a startup travel agency called Kogito Travel Agency.
The system will consist of a Kogito _Booking System Service_ implemented with a BPMN2 process definition and rules.

image:images/travels-process.png[]

The _Hotel Booking_ and _Flight Booking_ functionalities are implemented as _private_ subprocesses

image:images/book-hotel-process.png[]

image:images/book-flight-process.png[]

These processes call _Hotel Booking Service_ and _Flight Booking Service_, which are both implemented as CDI beans that have hard coded logic to return a booked flight or hotel.

----
org.acme.travels.service.HotelBookingService
org.acme.travels.service.FlightBookingService
----

Obviously this has been done for simplicity reasons. In a real application these functionalities would be implemented as microservices. However, the current implementation does show the power of Kogito processes definition integration with CDI.

== Cloning the repository
You are provided with a GitHub repository that contains 4 Kogito projects:

* 01-kogito-travel-agency: The base project which contains the _Booking System Service_. This project deploys as a single Quarkus application (JAR or Native Image) and does not support persistence.
* 02-kogito-travel-agency: The base project with persistence support. This project requires Infinispan / JBoss Data Grid.
* 03-kogito-travel-agency: Extension of project 3 with Kafka integration support to implement an Event Driven _Booking System Service_.
* 03-kogito-visas: A second kogito project which contains the _Visa Applications_ service. The _Booking System Service_ interacts with the this service through Kafka. 

The GitHub repository can be found here: https://github.com/rhte2019-kogito/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial/


. Login to your workstation as explained in the previous paragraph.
. When logged in, clone the Kogito Lab repository:
+
----
$ git clone https://github.com/rhte2019-kogito/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial.git
----
+
. Navigate tot the _Kogito Travel Agency Tutorial_ folder.
+
----
$ cd kogito-travel-agency-tutorial
----
+
. This folder contains the 3 projects that we will use during this lab.
. Switch to the `rhte2019` branch of the repository.
+
----
$ git checkout rhte2019

== Lab 1: Kogito Development

https://kogito.kie.org/[_Kogito_] is the _Cloud-Native Business Automation platform for building Intelligent Applications_.
It's build on top of https://www.quarkus.io[Quarkus], a _Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards_.

One of the focusses of Quarkus, and thus of Kogito, is _Developer Experience_. Functionalities like _dev mode_ and _hot reload_ allows developers to make changes in their source code and configuration files, and immediately have these changes available in their test environment, without the need to explicitly compile and redeploy the application. This _hot reload_ functionality is only activated when the application is refreshed (for example when hitting the application with a RESTful request).

When you run `mvn compile quarkus:dev` {project-name}, the Kogito/Quarkus application will launch in development mode. When
it receives a HTTP request it will hold the request, and check to see if any application source
files (Java code, process definitions, rule definitions, etc.) have been changed. If they have it will transparently compile the changed files, redeploy
the application with the changed files, and then the HTTP request will continue to the redeployed
application. Project redeploys are much faster than a traditional app server, so for all but the largest
applications this should take well under a second. This greatly speeds up a developer's development cycle.

Kogito provides support for not only hot-reloading source code, but also business assets, like BPMN2 process definitions, DMN decision definitions, DRL rule files, Excel-based decision tables. This makes Kogito and its supported resources a first-class-citizen in the Quarkus eco-system.

In this part of the lab, we will experience the _hot-reload_ semantics of Kogito by altering the rules of our _Kogito Travel Agency_ application.

. From the `/home/lab-user/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial` folder, navigate to the `01-kogito-travel-agency` folder.
+
----
$ cd 01-kogito-travel-agency
----
+
. Run the Maven command to start the Kogito application in _dev-mode_.
+
----
$ mvn clean package quarkus:dev
----
+
. If everything executed correctly, you will now see the application running in _dev-mode_.

----
+

We can see that the applications has a number of features installed, including _kogito_ to provide intelligent business application support, _resteasy_ to provide RESTful support, and _swagger-ui_ to provide swagger support.

Let's first access the application via the provided user interface.

. On your laptop, open a browser (Chrome, Firefox) and navigate to your workstation at: http://workstation-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com:8080 (replace $GUID with the GUID provided to you)
. You will see the following application UI.
image:images/kogito-travel-agency-ui-home.png[]

First we want to explore the semantic of our service. As we can see in the process diagram, the first node that is executed is _Business Rules_ node.

image:images/travels-process.png[]

This node executes the rules that determine whether an booking requires a visa or not. The rules can be found in the `visa-rules.drl` file located in the package `org.acme.travels` in the `src/main/resources` folder of the project.
Let's take a quick look at the rules:

----
rule "Polish citizens require visa to US"
	ruleflow-group "visas"
	when
		$trip: Trip($trip.country == "US")
		$traveller : Traveller($traveller.nationality == "Polish")
	then
		$trip.setVisaRequired( true );
end

rule "Polish citizens do not require visa to UK"
	ruleflow-group "visas"
	when
		$trip: Trip($trip.country == "UK")
		$traveller : Traveller($traveller.nationality == "Polish")
	then
		$trip.setVisaRequired( false );
end

rule "Polish citizens require visa to Australia"
	ruleflow-group "visas"
	when
		$trip: Trip($trip.country == "Australia")
		$traveller : Traveller($traveller.nationality == "Polish")
	then
		$trip.setVisaRequired( true );
end
----

What we can see is that, depending on the destination country, a `Traveller` from Poland either requires a visa or not. In this lab we will change one of these rules to demonstrate the _hot-reload_ functionality.

. Open the UI of the application and click on the blue _"+ Plan new trip"_ button.
. In the form, enter the following values and click on the blue _"Book your trip"_ button:
* Traveller:
** First Name: "Jan"
** Last Name: "Kowalski"
** Email: "jan.kowalski@example.com"
** Nationality: "Polish"
** Street: "Polna"
** City: "Krakow"
** Zip code: "32000"
** Country: "Poland"
* Trip:
** Country: "Australia"
** City: "Brisbane"
** Begin at: "2019-09-22"
** End at: "2019-09-27"
+
image:images/booking-with-visa.png[]
+
. A new entry should appear in the list of travels. The entry shows that a visa is required, indicating that the business rules have determined that a traveller from Poland travelling to Australia requires a visa.
image:images/travels-list.png[]
. Click on the _"Tasks"_ button. A task named _"Visa Application"_ should appear.
image:images/visa-application-task.png[]

 Let's now change this rule in such a way that a traveller from Poland does *not* require a visa when travelling to Australia. We will change the rule in our _DRL_ file and demonstrate the _hot-reload_ feature of Kogito.

 . Open a new SSH session to your workstation. This allows us to change one of our source files, while we keep our application running in _dev-mode_ in our other terminal.
 +
 ----
 $ export GUID=<your GUID obtained from the GuidGrabber>
 $ ssh lab-user@workstation-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
 ----
 * When prompted, enter the password provided by the instructor.
 . Navigate to the project folder:
 +
 ----
 $ cd kogito-travel-agency-tutorial/01-kogito-travel-agency
 ----
. Open the `visa-rules.drl` file using VIM
+
----
$ vim src/main/resources/org/acme/travels/visa-rules.drl
----
+
. Navigate to the rule with the name _"Polish citizens require visa to Australia"_ and change the `then` (the rule consequence) in such a way that no visa is required:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
rule "Polish citizens require visa to Australia"
  ruleflow-group "visas"
when
  $trip: Trip($trip.country == "Australia")
  $traveller : Traveller($traveller.nationality == "Polish")
then
  *$trip.setVisaRequired( false );*
end
----
+
. Save and exit by pressing `:wq` and `Enter`.
. In the application UI, create a new booking with the exact same data as the previous one. Observe that no visa is required.
image:images/booking-without-visa-hot-reload.png[]
. Go to the SSH terminal in which the application is running. The log will show that a change in the _DRL_ file was detected and Quarkus/Kogito reloaded the application:

----

We've seen the _hot-reload semantics of Kogito in action. Next we will look at how Kogito applications expose their RESTful API and how they adapt to your domain data.


== Lab 2: Domain Driven Business Applications

In previous versions of our Business Application platforms, the RESTful services always exposed generic RESTful APIs. An example of this was the commands-based API to invoke Drools Rules via KIE-Server, and the Map-based input parameters when starting a jBPM businesss process.

In Kogito, the exposed (RESTful) services are generated based on your domain data. In other words, Kogito adopts to your business domain rather than the other way around. This prevents the leaking of abstractions of the platform into your client applications and services and allows you to stay focused on the business and business domain instead of being concerned with the technology behind it.

Kogito accomplishes this by introspecting the business assets (process definitions, DRL, DMN, etc), and generating its remoting APIs based on the data-types and functionalities of your assets. This allows Kogito to expose domain specific APIs to its consumers.

A good way to demonstrate this is to inspect the Swagger documentation of our _Kogito Travel Agency_ application.

. With the _Kogito Travel Agency_ application still running, navigate to http://workstation-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com:8080/swagger-ui (replace $GUID with the GUID provided to you).
. Inspect the Swagger documentation. Note that the API defines RESTful resources like `Travel` and `VisaApplication` instead of `Process` and `Tasks`.
image:images/kogito-swagger.png[]

*TODO*: Have people start a Travel via the Swagger UI.

== Lab 3: Kogito Persistence

TODO: Elaborate on persistence mechanism.

In this section of the lab we will use the `02-kogito-travel-agency` project, which is the same project as used in the previous lab, but this time with persistence enabled. We use _Infinispan_ as persistent data store for process data. +
In the lab we will deploy the application to OpenShift. We will also build and deploy a native image to OpenShift.

=== Local test of the application

. From the `/home/lab-user/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial` folder, navigate to the `02-kogito-travel-agency` folder.
+
----
$ cd 02-kogito-travel-agency
----
. Inspect the POM file of the project. Take note of the dependencies to `io.quarkus:quarkus-infinispan-client` and `org.kie.kogito:infinispan-persistence-addon`. This is all it takes to enable persistence using Infinispan.
. Inspect the contents of `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
+
----
quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list=localhost:11222
----
+
The `quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list` entry defines the list of Infinispan servers for the Quarkus Infinispan client to connect to upon startup. The Quarkus Infinispan client uses the _Infinispan Hot Rod_ protocol to connect to a remote Infinispan server.
. Start a local instance of Infinispan on the lab workstation using Podman. +
Open a new terminal, ssh into the workstation as user `lab-user`, and run the following commands:
+
----
$ sudo podman run -it -p 11222:11222 jboss/infinispan-server:10.0.0.Beta3
----
+
Let the Infinispan server start up. After a couple of seconds you will see the following output:
+
----
05:25:15,708 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0025: Infinispan Server 10.0.0.Beta3 (WildFly Core 6.0.2.Final) started in 5484ms - Started 227 of 275 services (133 services are lazy, passive or on-demand)

----
. Create a couple of travel requests using the application UI or the Swagger UI.
. Press `Ctrl-C` to shut down the application. Keep the Infinispan server running. Start the application again in _dev mode_. Notice that the travel requests are still present.
. At this point feel free to shut down both the application as the Infinispan server.

=== Deployment to OpenShift - JVM mode

. From the lab workstation, login into the OpenShift cluster using the `oc` utility as `user1`:
+
----
$ oc login -u user1 https://master00.example.com -u user1
----
. Create a project for the Kogito Travel Agency application
+
----
$ oc new-project kogito
----
. The `openshift` folder of the `02-kogito-travel-agency` project contains a OpenShift template file for an Infinispan deployment. It will create a minimal Infinispan deployment, consisting of 1 node, with disabled security,and  exposing a Hot Rod endpoint on port 11222. To deploy Infinispan on your OpenShift cluster:
+
----
$ oc process -f openshift/infinispan-server.yml | oc create -f - -n kogito
----
. Follow the deployment of the Infinispan server on the OpenShift console, or use `oc`:
+
----
$ oc get pods -w
----
+
.Output
----
NAME                                 READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE

infinispan-server-656b846c7c-rgz8z   1/1       Running   0         1m
----

. By default, the Kogito Travel Agency app will try to connect to a Infinispan server on `localhost:11222`. When deploying on OpenShift, we need to configure the application to connect a remote Infinispan instance. To override the default configuration properties we can use a ConfigMap containing an `application.properties` file which will be mounted inside the application pod.
.. On the lab workstation, create a file `/tmp/application.properties`.
+
----
$ touch /tmp/application.properties
----
+
Using `vim`, add the following content to the file:
+
----
quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list=infinispan-server.kogito.svc:11222
----

.. Create a ConfigMap from the `application.properties` file:
+
----
$ oc create configmap kogito-travel-agency --from-file=/tmp/application.properties -n kogito
----

. The `openshift` folder of the `02-kogito-travel-agency` project contains a OpenShift template file for a binary deployment of the Kogito Travel Agency app. It describes a BuildConfig, ImageStream, DeploymentConfig, Service and Route for the application. In this lab, we will deploy the application itself usng a binary build from the lab workstation. +
Review the `kogito-travel-agency.yml` template file.
+
* We use the `redhat-openjdk18-openshift` image as a builder image. In JVM mode the application requires a JVM to run.
* The `kogito-travel-agency` ConfigMap is mounted in the `/deployments/config` directory of the pod.

. Deploy the template to the OpenShift cluster:
+
----
$ oc process -f openshift/kogito-travel-agency.yml | oc create -f - -n kogito
----
+
.Output
----
service/kogito-travel-agency created
route.route.openshift.io/kogito-travel-agency created
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/kogito-travel-agency created
buildconfig.build.openshift.io/kogito-travel-agency created
imagestream.image.openshift.io/kogito-travel-agency created
----

. On the lab workstation, build the Kogito Travel Agency app:
+
----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests=true
----
+
The project unit tests require a running local Infinispan instance, so we can skip them.

. Inspect the `target` folder of the project:
+
----
$ ls target

== Lab 4: Event Driven Kogito with Kafka

Events are first class citizens in Kogito. The runtime emits events based on the execution context of given request. The main aim for these events is to notify 3rd parties about changes to the process instance and its data. To avoid too many events being sent and to optimise both producer and consumer side there will be only one event per process instance emitted.
That event will consists of relevant information such as:

* process instance metadata e.g. process id, process instance id, process instance state, etc
* node instances executed, list of all node instances that have been triggered/left during the execution
* variables - current state of variables after the execution

These events will provide complete view over the process instances being executed.

The event format follows the CloudEvents (https://cloudevents.io) specification.

Events by default are only emitted when there is at least on publisher defined. There might be many event publishers that can be used to send/publish these events into different channels etc.

Out of the box Kogito ships with an event publisher using Quarkus Reactive Messaging - which allows to send events to Kafka, AMQP, MQTT, Camel.

Another use case for events is communication between process instances. The BPMN Message Event nodes in the Kogito runtime publish and consume messages from Kafka topics.

In this lab you will explore the integration of Kogito with Kafka.

In the version of the Kogito Travel Agency appliction used in this lab the event publishing mechanism has been enabled and configured to send events to a Kafka queue. 

The Kogito travel booking process definition has been expanded to send a _VisaApplication_ object to a Kafka topic every time a traveler needs to apply for a visa. This is modeled with a BPMN _Message End Event_ node, where the _MessageEventDefinition_ corresponds to the name of the Quarkus messaging channel where the the message is sent to. The payload of the message (a `VisaApplication` object) is defined though a data input association.

image::images/travels-process-2.png[]

A second Kogito application - _Kogito Visas_ - has a process definition with a BPMN _Message Start Event_ mapped to the same Kafka topic. For every message consumed from the Kafka topic a new process instance will be created.

image::images/visa-applications-process.png[]

This version of the Kogito Travel Agency app is dependent on a running Kafka cluster. We could spin up a local containerized Kafka cluster, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll deploy the app directly to OpenShift, using a native image.

=== Kogito Travel Agency application

. From the `/home/lab-user/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial` folder, navigate to the `03-kogito-travel-agency` folder.
+
----
$ cd 03-kogito-travel-agency
----
. Create Kafka topics for the event publishing mechanism and the Kogito Travel Agency application. +
The event publishing mechanism uses a queue named `kogito-processinstances-events`. +
The Message End Node in de travel booking process is mapped to the queue `visaapplications`. +
The `openshift/kafka-topics.yml` in the project folder contains Custom Resource definitions for both queues. Create the CRs in the `kafka-cluster` namespace:
+
----
$ oc create -f openshift/kafka-topics.yml -n kafka-cluster
----
+
.Output
----
kafkatopic.kafka.strimzi.io/visaapplications created
kafkatopic.kafka.strimzi.io/kogito-processinstances-events created
----

. Create a new namespace `kogito2` for the Kogito Travel Agency application.
+
----
$ oc new-project kogito2
----

. The Kogito application is configured for persistence, so we need to deploy an Infinispan server:
+
----
$ oc process -f openshift/infinispan-server.yml | oc create -f - -n kogito2
----

. Review the `pom.xml` file of the application. Notice the dependencies to `org.kie.kogito:kogito-events-reactive-messaging-addon`, `io.quarkus:quarkus-kafka-client` and `io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka` which are required for Kafka integration.

. Review the configuration file in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
+
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.visaapplications.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.visaapplications.topic=visaapplications
mp.messaging.outgoing.visaapplications.value.serializer=org.acme.travels.json.VisaApplicationJsonbSerializer

mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.topic=kogito-processinstances-events
mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
----
+
* The `mp.messaging.outgoing` entries map a Quarkus outgoing channel to the `smallrye-kafka` connector and the `visaapplications` and `kogito-processinstances-events` topics.

. Create a ConfigMap for the application to set the location of the Infinispan server and the Kafka broker for the messaging channels.
.. On the lab workstation, create a file `/tmp/application.properties`. Delete the existing file from the previous lab.
+
----
$ rm /tmp/application.properties
$ touch /tmp/application.properties
----
+
Using `vim`, add the following content to the file:
+
----
quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list=infinispan-server.kogito2.svc:11222

mp.messaging.outgoing.visaapplications.bootstrap.servers=kafka-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.kafka-cluster.svc:9092

mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.bootstrap.servers=kafka-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.kafka-cluster.svc:9092
----
.. Create a ConfigMap from the `application.properties` file:
+
----
$ oc create configmap kogito-travel-agency --from-file=/tmp/application.properties -n kogito2
----

. Build a Linux 64-bit native executable of the Kogito Travel Agency application:
+
----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests=true -Pnative
----

. Build a Docker image with the native executable. The `src/main/docker` folder contains a Docker file based on a minimal RHEL8 UBI image. Build the Docker image using Podman. Tag the image as version `0.0.2` to differentiate from the version in the previous lab:
+
----
$ sudo podman build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t kogito-travel-agency:0.0.2 .
----
. Follow the same steps as in the previous lab to push the native image to the OpenShift registry.
. Deploy the Kogito Travel Agency application:
+
----
$ oc process -f openshift/kogito-travel-agency-native.yml | oc create -f - -n kogito2
----
+
.Output
----
service/kogito-travel-agency-native created
route.route.openshift.io/kogito-travel-agency-native created
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/kogito-travel-agency-native created
----

=== Kogito Visas application

. From the `/home/lab-user/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial` folder, navigate to the `03-kogito-visas` folder.
+
----
$ cd 03-kogito-visas
----

. Review the configuration file in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

=== Kafka Consumer application

The Kogito Travel Agency and Kogito Visas applications emit events to a Kafka queue whenever a new processinstance is created or its internal state changes. In order to observe these events, we deploy a simple native Quarkus application that consumes these events and prints its contents to _stdout_.

. From the `/home/lab-user/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial` folder, navigate to the `kafka-consuler` folder.
+
----
$ cd kafka-consumer
----

. Create a ConfigMap for the application to set the location of the Kafka broker and the topic to consume from.
.. On the lab workstation, create a file `/tmp/application.properties`. Delete the existing file from the previous lab.

Using `vim`, add the following content to the file:
+

mp.messaging.incoming.messages.topic=kogito-processinstances-events
mp.messaging.incoming.messages.group.id=kafka-consumer
----
.. Create a ConfigMap from the `application.properties` file:
+
----
$ oc create configmap kafka-consumer --from-file=/tmp/application.properties -n kogito2
----

. Deploy the application:
+
----
$ oc process -f openshift/kafka-consumer-native.yml | oc create -f - -n kogito2
----

=== Test the application

. Create a travel booking in the Kogito Travel Agency application using the application UI or the Swagger UI. +
As an example, use the following payload:
+
----
{
"traveller" : {
"firstName" : "John",
"lastName" : "Doe",
"email" : "john.doe@example.com",
"nationality" : "Polish",
"address" : {
"street" : "Main Street",
"city" : "London",
"zipCode" : "12345",
"country" : "UK"
}
},
"trip" : {
"city" : "New York",
"country" : "US",
"begin" : "2019-12-10T00:00:00.000+02:00",
"end" : "2019-12-31T00:00:00.000+02:00"
}
}
----
+
According to the rules defined in both applications, a visa application is required for this trip, and the visa application cannot be processed automatically.

. Verify using the Kogito Travel Agency UI that a travel booking has been created.
+
image:images/travel-agency-ui.png[]
. Complete the Visa application task. Fill in a bogus passport number, and a duration of 30 (days) and submit the application.
. Verify in the Visa application that a Visa application has been created which requires manual approval:
+
image::images/visa-approval-ui.png[]

. Check the logs of the Kafka Consumer app. Note that several events have been sent by the Kogito runtimes to the `kogito-processinstances-events` Kafka topic. The events contain information about the process instance, the nodes triggered and the state of the process variables:

== Lab 5: Kogito Data Index Service

The _Kogito Data Index Service_ is a Quarkus based application that aims to capture and index data produced by one more Kogito runtime services. It consumes the events emitted by the Kogito runtime event publisher and stores and indexes them in an Infinispan cluster.

image::images/data-index-architecture.jpg[]

The Data Index Service is not intended to be used as permanent storage or audit log information. The focus is to make business domain data easily accessible for processes that are currently in progress.

In its current version, it uses Kakfa messaging to consume _CloudEvents_ based messages from Kogito runtimes, process and index the information for later consumption via GraphQL queries.

The Data Index Service is capable of indexing custom process models, if it has access to the Protobuf definition files of the model.

The Data Index Service is bundled with the _GraphiQL_ (https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) UI, which allows exploring and querying the available data model. Alternatively, it is also possible to use a GraphQL client API to communicate with the exposed GraphQL endpoint.

In this lab we will deploy the Data Index Service to OpenShift, and explore its indexing and querying functionalities.

. From the `/home/lab-user/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial` folder, navigate to the `data-index-service` folder.
+
----
$ cd data-index-service
----

. Create a ConfigMap for the Data Index Service to set the location of the Infinispan server and the Kafka broker.
.. On the lab workstation, create a file `/tmp/application.properties`. Delete the existing file from the previous lab.
+
----
$ rm /tmp/application.properties
$ touch /tmp/application.properties
----

----
+
* `kogito.cache.domain.template` is the Infinispan cache template used by the Data Index Service. This tempate must exist on the Infinispan server.
* `kogito.protobuf.folder` is the directory where the Data Index Service looks for Protobuf definition files for domain specific models. 
+
.. Create a ConfigMap from the `application.properties` file:
+
----
$ oc create configmap data-index-service --from-file=/tmp/application.properties -n kogito2
----

. Create a ConfigMap for the Protobuf files for the Data Index Service.
.. The Protobuf definition files for the domain models for the Kogito Travel Agency and Visas applications are generated when the project is build. They are stored in the `target/classes/persistence` directory of the project.
+
----
$ ls ../03-kogito-travel-agency/target/classes/persistence
----
+
.Output
----
kogito-application.proto  travels.proto
----

.. Create a ConfigMap from the Protobuf files:
+
----
$ oc create configmap data-index-service-proto --from-file=../03-kogito-travel-agency/target/classes/persistence/travels.proto --from-file=../03-kogito-visas/target/classes/persistence/visaApplications.proto -n kogito2
----

. Deploy the Data Index Service on OpenShift. We use a pre-built image of the application.
+
----
$ oc process -f openshift/data-index-service.yml | oc create -f - -n kogito2
----
+
.Output
----
service/data-index-service created
route.route.openshift.io/data-index-service created
deployment.apps/data-index-service created
----

. Create a number of travel applications and visa applications using the Kogito Travel Agency and Kogito Visas UI (or the Swagger UI)

. In a browser window, navigate to the URL of the Data Index Service.

. In the left pane of the UI, create a GraphQL query. Notice the autocomplete features of the UI. For example, to query for all the process instances in the Kogito runtimes:
+
----
{
  ProcessInstances {
    id
    processId
    state
    variables
  }
}
----
+
image::images/data-index-service-ui-query.png[]

. It is possible to filter on fields. For example, to query for active process instances of processId `travels`:
+
----
{
  ProcessInstances(filter: {state: ACTIVE, limit: 10, processId: "travels"}) {
    id
    processId
    state
    variables
  }
}
----

. The Data Index Service knows about the domain specific models used in the Kogito runtimes, so you can create queries using these models:
+
----
{
  Travels {
    traveller {
      firstName
      lastName
      nationality
    }
  }
}
----

----
{
  VisaApplications {
    visaApplication {
      firstName
      lastName
      duration
      country
    }    
  }
}
